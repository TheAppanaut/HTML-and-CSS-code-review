    <h4><em>Computer Programming Student</em></h4>
    <p><img src="../img/waterfall.jpg" alt="a picture of me standing on the edge of a small waterfall  near Multnomah Falls"></p>
    <p><strong>I am a Californian living in Portland, Oregon.</strong></p>

    <p>I have worked in the pet retail business for the last 5 years, doing everything from scrubbing fish tanks to running store operations. It wasn't until I began work at a small local pet store that I caught an interest in computer programming. My new store needed help with their website, and it seemed like something I would enjoy, so I went home and got to studying! I now plan on attending Epicodus in 2016, with the hopes of making programming a full-time job.</p>
